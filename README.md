# Easy Authenticator

Easy Authenticator is a TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) Manager app built using Flutter. This app aims to replace common tools or apps on your phone with a custom-built solution. As the first app I developed myself, it focuses on simplicity and functionality.

## Features

- **TOTP Management**: Manage multiple TOTP accounts with ease.
- **Manual Entry**: Add accounts manually by entering the account name and secret key.
- **QR Code Scanning**: Scan QR codes to automatically add TOTP accounts.
- **Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark modes.
- **Automatic Code Generation**: Generate TOTP codes every 30 seconds.
